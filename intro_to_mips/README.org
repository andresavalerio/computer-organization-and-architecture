* Introduction: MIPS

1. Read an integer number and, if it is greater than zero, print it's double.
2. Read 3 numbers and print the sum of the 2 lowest.
3. Inicialize 3 registers with integer numbers and verify if the correspond to a sequence by the power of 2.

** Relevant operations
*** Assembler directives
Assembler directives are directions to the assembler to take some action or change a setting. 
#+BEGIN_SRC 
    .data # The following data items should be stored in the data segment. 
txt: .asciiz "string" # .asciiz -> Store the string in memory and null-terminate it

    .text # The next items are put in the user text segment. In SPIM, these items may only be instructions or words.
    .globl main # Declare that symbol main is global and can be referenced from other files.
#+END_SRC

*** Printing a message

#+BEGIN_SRC 
    .data
msg: .asciiz "Hello, World!"

    li $v0,4 # code 4 -> syscall print_string
    la $a0, msg # load the string from msg
    syscall
#+END_SRC
